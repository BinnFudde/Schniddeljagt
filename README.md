# Schniddeljagt

A daring attempt to create alternatives for Father's Day. Normally a parade in a larger group with plenty of drinks is obligatory on this day. Due to certain circumstances, this is probably not possible to the usual extent. Therefore this project "Schniddeljagt" was brought into life.
Its purpose is to illustrate a kind of scavenger hunt. This is done in several smaller teams and the individual targets are equipped with QR codes, which gives each team the puzzle for the next station.
